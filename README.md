My batch files for optimizing work and leisure

There are currently 2 bat files in this repository

1. Work
2. Games

Work.bat file:
Closes Steam, if open
Cleans memory killing idle processes
Opens software I use for working

Games.bat file:
Closes all work softwares
Cleans memory killing idle processes
Opens steam

This works for me, I hope it might help you too!
